The goal is to show how agents can support safety engineers by:\n\n- Looking up relevant guideline snippets from a small **mini-standard** knowledge base  \n- Generating concrete, actionable checklist items grouped by development phase  \n- Reviewing the checklist to ensure that critical safety activities are not missing  \n- Laying the groundwork for iterative, project-level refinement with sessions and memory\n\n\n### ADK concepts demonstrated\n\nThis notebook focuses on the following ADK concepts:\n\n- **Tools** – custom ADK tools for mini-standard lookup and checklist formatting, plus a small Python helper for coarse, keyword-based risk estimation  \n- **Agent architectures** – a two-agent workflow with a **Planner agent** that proposes a phase-based checklist and a **Checker agent** that reviews and augments it  \n- **Memory / sessions** – using `user_id` and `session_id` with `InMemorySessionService` and `Runner` to keep basic project-level context and support future iterative refinement  \n- **Evaluation & observability** – a small test set of example systems with an automatic coverage metric over “must-have” topics (e.g. HARA, safety goals, verification plan, safety case)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

The notebook first computes a coarse-grained\n  risk label (`low`, `medium`, `high`) in Python using the\n  `risk_estimator_tool`. This `risk_level`, together with the system\n  `description`, `domain`, and target standard (e.g. `iso26262`), is passed\n  into the Planner as context.\n\n  Inside the agent, two ADK tools are available:\n  - `standard_lookup_tool(standard, phase)` queries the `mini_standard`\n    knowledge base and returns phase-tagged guideline snippets for ISO 26262–\n    inspired activities.\n  - `checklist_formatter_tool(tasks)` groups raw task suggestions into a\n    dictionary `phase -> [\"- [ ] ...\"]`, which is easy to render as a\n    Markdown checklist.\n\n  The Planner uses these tools to propose concrete, short, imperative tasks\n  and to produce a phase-based checklist with headings such as\n  `### Concept phase`, `### Design phase`, etc.\n\n- **CheckerAgent**  \n  A second LLM agent that reviews the Planner's checklist. It receives the\n  system description, the pre-estimated risk level, and the grouped checklist\n  in Markdown form. Guided by its instruction, it:\n  - checks whether key safety concepts (HARA / risk assessment, safety goals,\n    verification / test plan, safety case) are present for medium and high\n    risk systems,\n  - adds missing items where needed, and\n  - returns an updated checklist plus short review notes.\n\nThe overall flow for a single system is therefore:\n\n1. Pick a system entry from the `systems` list.\n2. Compute `risk_level = risk_estimator_tool(system[\"description\"])` in Python.\n3. Send the description, domain, standard, and `risk_level` to the PlannerAgent.\n4. Feed the Planner's checklist into the CheckerAgent together with the\n   system description and `risk_level`.\n5.

Conclusion\n\nIn this notebook, **SafetyCopilot**, a functional safety checklist agent built with Google's **Agent Development Kit (ADK)** was implemented.\n\nThe agent:\n\n- Uses tools to look up a **mini-standard** knowledge base, estimate a simple risk level, and format tasks into phase-based checklists  \n- Combines a **PlannerAgent** and a **CheckerAgent** to generate and refine functional safety work plans  \n- Stores project-level information through **sessions / memory** via the `user_id` and `session_id` parameters  \n- Provides a simple **evaluation** on example systems, measuring coverage of key safety concepts such as HARA, safety goals, verification plans, and safety cases\n\nThis project demonstrates how ADK can be used to prototype **enterprise agents** that support functional safety engineers in a structured way.  \nWith more time, SafetyCopilot could be extended by:\n\n- Covering richer and more detailed safety standards and domain profiles  \n- Using more nuanced risk modeling instead of a simple keyword heuristic  \n- Allowing interactive editing of generated checklists in a human-in-the-loop workflow  \n- Integrating with existing enterprise requirements / ALM tools to export tasks and traceability links\n","metadata":{}}]}
